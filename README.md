# Spatial-Machine-Learning-Analysis-of-Student-Residential-Rental-Pricing-in-UCSB

  UCSB’s student housing issues have plagued the community for years, which the 2020 Grad Students Strike best exemplifies. Hence, identifying students’ housing preferences is crucial for UCSB’s future expansion and sustained growth as a prestigious academic institution. The demand for such knowledge is made even more urgent with UCSB’s controversial windowless “Mega-Dorm” proposal that sparked national debate.
  
  Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify influential factors on students’ housing rental prices to deduce students’ rental preferences using online proprietary and open-source databases and a purpose-built campus-wide online survey in the case study submarket of UCSB student residential rentals. We will compare multiple spatial and non-spatial machine learning methods using the different data courses. In the end, we hope to turn our research into real-world software that would help students find their price range and ideal property based on their preferences.
